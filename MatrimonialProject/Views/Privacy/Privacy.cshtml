        MatrimonialProjectis strongly committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe online experience for all of our users and subscribers while offering the highest quality user experience to them. Because we gather certain types of information about and from you, our users and subscribers, you should understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of this information. This Privacy Policy discloses what information we gather, how we use it, how to correct or change it, and what steps we take to safeguard personal information provided to us both online and offline. Please read the complete Privacy Policy below, as well as our Terms of Use, and contact us if you have any questions.

        <p> WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</p>

        In order to use our Website, you will have to provide some personally identifiable information. In order to provide users and subscribers with the most efficient and enhanced personalized service and attention, we request information about you in certain circumstances and collect certain information automatically.

            Information You Volunteer
        </p>

        We collect personally identifiable information that you volunteer to us (such as your name, e-mail address, age, gender, and/or similar demographic information), when you subscribe to, or create an account with, or voluntarily register on our Website. Registration is required to participate in certain message boards, bulletin boards, chat rooms or surveys available on our Website.

            Information Collected Automatically
        </p>
        We may also automatically collect your IP and referring Website addresses, browser type, domain name and Website access times. This information helps facilitate your online experience on our Website. In addition, we use cookies to track usage patterns on our Website and to control the display of ads, as well as to offer other functionalities (such as screening for age, and “recognizing” you to speed up your log-in when you visit our Website). You can turn off cookies, but that will affect your online experience. Please see below for more detail on cookies.

            WHAT DO WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?
        </p>
        We use information you provide to fulfill your requests and improve our Website, products and services. We may, from time to time, produce reports for advertisers, sponsors and vendors containing anonymous, aggregate information about our users and subscribers, such as demographic, age and online usage information. This information allows us to provide content and offers that are most relevant to our subscribers and users and to work more closely with advertisers. We do not include any personally identifiable information of our users in these reports.

        We use personal information so that we may display or send custom, personalized content to our Website visitors and send newsletters, mail, e-mails, features, promotional material, surveys and other updates, information or offers to our users and subscribers. From time to time, we may also establish business relationships with other persons or entities that we believe to be trustworthy and whose privacy policies are generally consistent with our privacy policy (“Choice Partners”). In such cases we might share and cross-reference information, including personal information about you that will enable our Choice Partners to contact you regarding products and services that you might find of interest. We encourage you to visit the sites of these Choice Partners and evaluate their privacy policies for yourselves.

        A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving such information by linking to [information url] and following the instructions on those pages. We also use collected information to evaluate and administer our products and services, fulfill customer requests, respond to any future problems, such as difficulties in navigating our Website or accessing certain features, and to gauge user trends to determine what products and services are most popular with users.

        We allow users of our Website to send articles or links by e-mail to other parties who may be interested in them. We do not retain any e-mail addresses (unless you are a member who has already voluntarily provided your e-mail address) of either the sender or recipient of such articles or links after they are sent, and we do not share “send a friend” e-mail addresses with third parties. Of course, we use personal information to allow you to subscribe online. We and our technical and fulfillment agents, partners and consultants follow carefully proscribed procedures to safeguard credit card data in connection with your transactions and adhere to certain legal requirements.

            HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?
        </p>
        Personal information is available to Badonlinedates and the technical and fulfillment agents, partners and consultants who make our Website, products and services available to you. Anonymous information is available to our advertisers, sponsors and promotional and business partners. We share your personal information with third parties only as described below.

        Badonlinedates and Its Agents.

        Website hosting firms, technical and database consultants, advertising agencies, order processing partners, customer service partners and fulfillment firms may have access to personally identifiable information in the course of making our products and services available. All companies working for and with Badonlinedates must comply with our privacy policies, and are not permitted to sell your information to third parties or to use it except as authorized by us and you, or as permitted or required by law.

        Advertisers, Sponsors and Promotional and Business Partners.

        We share anonymous, aggregate demographic information (such as gender, age, income, hobbies, interests, etc.), and anonymous information obtained from cookies and similar technologies, with our advertisers, sponsors, promotional and business partners, and participating vendors. No personally identifiable information is disclosed to any of these third parties in providing these reports.

        Your e-mail address is not shared with third parties unless you agree to receive information, by opting-in, from third parties. In other words, we may extend e-mail offers to users or subscribers on behalf of our business partners about a particular product or service that may be of interest to you, but only if you have indicated that you would like to receive these offers. If you wish to receive such offers, we will not share or disclose your name or e-mail address to those business partners, but will send you the information or offers on their behalf. As a result, although Badonlinedates may receive a fee from our business partners for this service, Badonlinedates sends the offers so that your personal information is never shared with any outside third party. Of course, you may opt out of receiving these offers at any time.

        Sometimes we will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive e-mail offers from third parties not affiliated with Badonlinedates. If you decide to accept these offers, we will provide, with your consent, your contact information to the third party. On our Website, visitors will also have opportunities to sign up directly with certain advertisers and sponsors to enter contests or sweepstakes or to receive e-mail updates and other information directly from them. Third party vendors and advertisers will also use technical and other consultants. We urge visitors to review carefully the privacy policies of these firms. Badonlinedates is not responsible for the privacy policies and procedures of any third party.

        You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, online in any community area (whether through Badonlinedates’ Website or any other service available online), that information can be collected and used by others. For example, if you use chat, forums, bulletin boards, blogs or message boards, or if you post personal information online (such as your e-mail address), you may receive unsolicited messages from others. Badonlinedates has no control over this use of your personal information. Important Note

        We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent for the following purposes: as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request; to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of our Website and our property; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation.

            SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
        </p>

Our policy is to limit access to personal data to those Badonlinedates employees or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve this information. We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled environments. To maintain security, we conduct internal reviews of our security measures on a regular basis. Remember, however, that any personal information you post in chat rooms, blogs or message boards is available to anyone.
